# Quiz Application

This project is a simple Quiz Application developed using JavaFX.

## Files

### App.java

`App.java` is the main class of the application. It extends `Application` and contains the `start` method, which initializes the JavaFX application by loading the main FXML file `quiz_menu.fxml` and displaying it in a window.

### QuizMenuController.java

`QuizMenuController.java` is the controller class for the Quiz Menu. It handles user interactions with the menu options, such as selecting multiple-choice, short-answer, or true/false questions. Currently, the methods in this class are placeholders for opening respective question pages, which can be implemented using FXMLLoader to load corresponding FXML files.

## Usage

To run the Quiz Application, follow these steps:
1. Ensure you have Java and JavaFX installed on your system.
2. Compile the Java files.
3. Run `App.java` to launch the application.

## Technologies Used

- JavaFX: JavaFX is used for building the graphical user interface (GUI) of the application.
- FXMLLoader: FXMLLoader is used to load FXML files, which define the layout and structure of the application's UI components.
